      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a very interesting video that demonstrates the power of using DDD
together with Ports &amp;amp; Adapters pattern. I totally agree with the concept.
By using Ports &amp;amp; Adapters you can easily understand the business logic without
having to look at boilerplate code (the ports and adapters).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker recommends the book &amp;ldquo;Building Microservices - Desining fine-grained
systems&amp;rdquo;. The speaker mentions that the book cover lots of ideas of DDD and
ports &amp;amp; adapters, that it is worth reading it in case you agree with the
things he speaks of.&lt;/p&gt;
