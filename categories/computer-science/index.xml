      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just amazing, Robert Martin (Uncle Bob) points out how the history of computer
science affects the way we develop code nowadays and the reason why lots of
amazing things were invented in the beginning and today we have the lack of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Martin also points out that we may end up being regulated in case
we don&amp;rsquo;t take control of the future of computer science, specially regarding
doing things right. He mentions that because at the moment people are
extremely affected by us, they are constantly interacting with software. Soon
people will accidentally, or not, start to being killed by software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also compares our industry to others like lawyers, doctors, etc, they all
have their ethic code, they can be banished in case they do intentionally
something wrong, even if they got asked to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
